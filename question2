#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void printarray (int arg[], int length) {
for (int n=0; n<length; n++)
cout << arg[n] << " "; cout << "\n";
}
int main (){
int firstarray[] = {5, 10, 15};
int secondarray[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
printarray (firstarray,2);
printarray (secondarray,5);
return 0;
}


output is:
5 10
2 4 6 8 10

The output is as above for we are using a for loop that sets n to 0 each time you call print array. 
Print array will print the length of any array that you pass it as long as length is less than or equal to the size of the array.
After we set the length of the first array to two the output was the first two elements (5,10) of the first array.
We then set the length of the second array to five and the output was the first five elements (2,4,6,8,10) of the second array.
